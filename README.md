# drp4camel
Dynamic Route Pulling for Camel

DRP is planned to have the following features:
- pull new routes from a remote repository like git
- load these routes dynamically without stopping the camel context
- have a dispatch mechanism that replace new versions of an existing route/service without any downtime
